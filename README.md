# ASHRAE Energy Prediction ML Pipeline

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow using the [ASHRAE Energy Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction) dataset. The dataset should be downloaded manually from Kaggle and placed in `data/ashrae-energy-prediction/`.

## Project Structure
- `data/ashrae-energy-prediction/` – place `train.csv`, `weather_train.csv`, and `building_metadata.csv` here
- `notebooks/template.ipynb` – notebook for interactive exploration
- `scripts/` – preprocessing, visualization and modeling utilities
- `results/` – outputs generated by the pipeline
- `main.py` – runs preprocessing, visualization, and modeling in order
- `venv/` – virtual environment (already created)

## Dependencies
See `requirements.txt` for the list of required packages. Activate the virtual environment and install them with:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Pipeline
After placing the Kaggle CSV files in the `data/ashrae-energy-prediction/` directory and installing dependencies, execute:
