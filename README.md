# Machine Learning Workflow Template

This project provides a structured starting point for machine learning experiments using a dataset (to be added later). It includes directories for data storage, notebooks for exploratory data analysis, scripts for processing and modeling, and a results folder for storing outputs and trained models.

## Project Structure

- `data/` – place raw and processed datasets here
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis
- `scripts/` – preprocessing, training, and evaluation scripts
- `results/` – outputs such as plots and trained models
- `main.py` – entry point coordinating the workflow

## Typical Workflow

1. **Data Loading** – `load_data()` reads the dataset from the `data/` directory.
2. **Preprocessing** – `preprocess_data()` cleans and prepares data.
3. **Visualization** – `visualize_data()` explores the dataset.
4. **ML Preparation** – `prepare_data_for_ml()` splits data and creates feature sets.
5. **Modeling** – `apply_ml_models()` trains machine learning models.
6. **Optimization** – `optimize_model()` tunes hyperparameters.
7. **Uncertainty Analysis** – `evaluate_uncertainty()` assesses model reliability.
8. **Dynamic Programming** – optional step in `dynamic_programming_control()`.
9. **Discussion** – `discuss_results()` summarizes findings and saves outputs to `results/`.

To get started, install the dependencies from `requirements.txt` and run `python main.py`.
